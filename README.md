# README for Abdullah's Interactive Terminal

<h1> Interactive Terminal</h1>

This is a basic macOS inspired web terminal that serves as a portfolion for me and provides some information about me. 
I made this project in order to learn more about Java Script and React.
The program features different type of commands including links to my socials and my resume. I have added the command help that gives the visitor a 
complete set of commands available for the terminal. 

<h1>How to Access the Terminal</h1>

I have deployed the Terminal Web app online and it can be accessed at:<br />

<h1>Future of this application</h1>

I just started learning ReactJS and JS so I will be updating this web app as I learn more in depth about these application.
Some notable things that I want to add in the next release of the website include a new auto-typer with a delay. A better GUI.
I also plan to add new commands over the time inlcuding some easter eggs for (potterheads). <br />
